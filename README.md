# heap-benchmarks
A heap data structure benchmark dataset.

Record structure <id, priority, operation type>.

Operation type: 0 deletes the element with the lowest priority; 1 inserts an element; 2 increases the priority; 3 decreases the priority;


Fibonacci heap, dary heap, binomial heap and skew heap in boost lib crash on multiple datasets including mix_25.edges!
Pairing heap crashes on larger datasets too!
